## Hello there 💞

I'm Kevin (he/him). I'm from London 🇬🇧 but now live mostly in Berlin 🇩🇪 and sometimes in Leiden 🇳🇱. I only fluently speak English. 

<!--By day I work at GitHub as a Senior Developer Advocate helping developers get the most out of the GitHub platform. By night--> 

As well as my day job, I run [a hackathon consultancy](https://hacklabs.events) focused on research & development, and help devtools companies with their developer experience through community, education, and tooling work which I've been doing since 2014.

He is wearing a patterned, short-sleeved maroon shirt and a silver chain necklace. His right forearm is covered with colorful Disney tattoos. The room is warmly lit, with blinds partially closed on the window to the left, casting soft shadows. Behind him, the wall is adorned with framed photographs. An old-fashioned black rotary phone is positioned on the table to his right." />

He is wearing a plain white T-shirt and a silver chain necklace. The background is a solid black, which contrasts with his light skin tone, highlighting his cheerful expression." />
