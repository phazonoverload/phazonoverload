## Hello there 💞

I'm Kevin (he/him). I'm from London 🇬🇧 but now live mostly in Berlin 🇩🇪 and sometimes in Leiden 🇳🇱. I only fluently speak English. 

By night I run [a hackathon consultancy](https://hacklabs.events) focused on research & development, and help devtools companies with their developer experience through community, education, and tooling work which I've been doing since 2014.
