Hi, I'm Kevin. I've been doing roles in Developer Relations since 2014 spanning community and events, education in all forms (docs, written guides, videos, workshops), and building tooling that helps developers build great projects. I care about building operationally-excellent programs and helping all teams within companies understand the power of writing code.
